I am a full-stack software engineer with experience building, maintaining, and deploying web applications using modern technologies like React, Node.js, Next.js, Rails, and more. I like projects that push me to my limits and force me out of my comfort zone.

Before becoming a software engineer, I was a professional philosopher, specializing in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science. I have a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Indiana, Bloomington. I am also a published author and taught philosophy at the college level for over a decade.

When I am not coding, I enjoy working on my Mandarin, reading science fiction, hiking, and keeping up with the latest developments in cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

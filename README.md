Four months ago I made the decision to leave academia and start a career in web development. After a lot of work, a bootcamp, half a dozen online courses, and several big projects, I can now code in Javascript, Ruby, HTML, and CSS. Currently I am most experienced with React and Ruby on Rails, but I look forward to learning other frameworks. I am currently hard at work on a language learning app that uses React on the frontend and a Rails API on the backend.
